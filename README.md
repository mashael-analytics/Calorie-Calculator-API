# Calorie Calculator API

A Python-based data analysis tool that interacts with the **USDA FoodData Central API** to fetch and process nutrition data (calories, protein, carbs, fat) for various food items.

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

- Python scripting
- Working with RESTful APIs (GET requests, parameters)
- Data extraction and transformation
- File handling (CSV)
- Preparing data for analysis using **pandas**

Perfect for data analysis, calorie tracking, and food research â€” built with real-world coding practices and clean, modular code.
